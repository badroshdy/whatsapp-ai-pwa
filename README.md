# WhatsApp-AI-PWA

Progressive Web App that summarises WhatsApp chats & turns articles into WhatsApp posts.  
Each visitor keeps their **own OpenAI key locally** – nothing hits a server.

## Use

2. Tap “Add / change key” → paste your OpenAI key → Save.  
3. Use the two tools; results are auto-copied to clipboard for quick paste back into WhatsApp.

## Install on iPhone
Safari → share icon ⎋ → “Add to Home Screen” → done. Works offline.
